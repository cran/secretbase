Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions, binary
    encoding and serialization. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly.
    Stream hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as
    in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism. Implements the
    SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256
    extendable-output function (XOF), 'SipHash' pseudo-random function,
    base64 and base58 encoding, and 'CBOR' serialization.
