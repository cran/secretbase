Title: Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
Version: 0.4.0
Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions. Performs direct
    hashing of strings, raw bytes, and files potentially larger than memory, as
    well as hashing in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism,
    without requiring allocation of the serialized object. Implementations
    include the SHA-256 and SHA-3 cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256
    extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function. The
    SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard was published by the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at <doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202>. The
    SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was published by NIST in 2002 at
    <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf>.
